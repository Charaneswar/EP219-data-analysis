Extracted the full data set for pre-primary schools having LKG, UKGand Nursery classes into a numpy array
Added a column to show the to show the total number of teachers per pre-primary school.
Made three histogrms of the number of states with a certain number of pre-primary school teachers per school - one each for rural ad urban areas and one for the entire data set.


                                                      Assignment-2
Extracted the full data set to a numpy or pandas array.
Made a histogram of the fraction of villages that are declared ODF in eachdistrict in UP (x-axis is fraction of ODF villages, y-axis is number of districts).
Found the mean, variance and standard deviation of the district-wise ODF fraction using self written functions to calculate these quantities.
Marked the sample mean (using a vertical line) and the sample standard deviation(using a horizontal line) on the histogram.

Used python to extract data about umemployment and crime rate.
Calculated mean and standard deviation and plotted 1-D histograms of unemployment and crime rate.
Made a 2-D histogram and scatter plot of crime rate v/s unemployment rate.
Found the corellation coefficient between crime rate and unemployment rate.

The likelihood of a hypothesis is a score which we assign to our hypothesis. It determines how efficientlyour hypothesis works. We want to detect a dark matter signal in the given data. We first plot a histogramwhen only background processes are responsible for the rebound energy.Then we add the effect of dark matter an plot a histogram for the same considering different values of the parameter ”σ”.We then find the log likelihood function and plot it.

Using the given data for number of events observed for different collision energies, we calculated the p value, verified whether the null hypothesis for the existence of dark matter can be ruled out or not and verified whether dark matter has been discovered at the 95% confidence level.
